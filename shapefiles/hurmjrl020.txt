  Description:
    Abstract:
      This Historical North Atlantic Hurricane Tracks file of major storms 
      with landfall in the United States contains the six-hourly (0000, 0600, 
      1200, 1800 UTC) center locations and intensities for all northern 
      Atlantic major storms from 1851 through 2004.  Major storms are those 
      that made landfall in the United States and that were classified on the 
      Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale as Category 3, 4, or 5 at the time of 
      landfall.  Landfalling storms are defined as those storms whose center 
      is reported to have either crossed or passed directly adjacent to the 
      United States coastline, and which came ashore with tropical storm 
      intensity or greater (sustained surface winds of 34 knots or 39 miles 
      per hour or greater).  In 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 there were no 
      major landfalling hurricanes.  This a replacement for the January 2005 
      map layer distributed as Historical North Atlantic Hurricane Tracks – 
      Major Storms with Landfall in the United States, 1851-2003.
    Purpose:
      These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the 
      national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale 
      data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Oceanic and 
      Atmospheric Administration or the National Atlas of the United States 
      in the use of these data.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      Specific accuracy information can be found in Neumann, C.J., B.R. 
      Jarvinen, C.J. McAdie and G.R. Hammer, 1999: Tropical Cyclones of the 
      North Atlantic Ocean, 1871-1999 (fifth revision).  NCDC/NHC Historical 
      Climatology Series 6-2, pp.11-14.  Similar standards and techniques 
      were applied to the post-1999 data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    Over-water portions of storm tracks before 1944 are subject to 
    considerable uncertainties.  Aircraft reconnaissance of storms near 
    critical areas was introduced in 1944, and continuous weather satellite 
    surveillance was introduced in the mid-1960s.  These two developments 
    mean that more recent storm records have a higher degree of accuracy than 
    those prior to 1944.  No tests for logical consistency have been 
    performed on this map layer.
  Completeness_Report: 
    This map layer contains all known Atlantic Basin (Gulf of Mexico, 
    Caribbean Sea, and North Atlantic Ocean) major hurricanes that made 
    landfall in the United States and that occurred between 1851 and 2004.  
    Major landfalling hurricanes are those that were  classified on the 
    Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale as Category 3, 4, or 5 at the time of 
    landfall.  In 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 there were no major landfalling 
    hurricanes. 

  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Over-water portions of storm tracks before 1944 are subject to 
        considerable uncertainties.  Aircraft reconnaissance of storms near 
        critical areas was introduced in 1944, and continuous weather 
        satellite surveillance was introduced in the mid-1960s.  These two 
        developments allow a high degree of probability that more recent 
        storm center locations were determined with a reasonable degree of 
        accuracy.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: 
        To create Atlas-hurall04 from ATL_2004, historical track information 
        was downloaded from the National Hurricane Center's Web site.  The 
        ASCII text file was formatted into an Arc/INFO table using AML.  The 
        INFO table was then processed into a generate file and an attribute 
        table that were converted into an attributed cover.  

        Location points are recorded every six hours.  Each recorded point 
        was associated with a unique line that extends from that point to the 
        next recorded point.  Small line segments, approximately 0.0001 
        degree long, were added to the end of each storm track to retain the 
        final collection point's information.  In the source data, tracks 
        that crossed the 0-degree longitude line had negative longitude 
        values even in the eastern hemisphere.  These longitude values were 
        converted to the corresponding positive longitude values.

        A limit in the processing software will not allow duplicate points, 
        so where a storm stood still longer than the six-hour collection 
        interval, the next location point was offset approximately 0.0001 
        degrees to retain relevant information.  

        During the process of creating Atlas-hurall04, information on 
        landfalling storms was extracted to an INFO table.  This information 
        was joined to Atlas-hurall04 and used to extract landfalling major 
        hurricanes, which are those that made landfall as category 3 or higher.  

        The cover was converted into a shapefile and an SDTS-formatted file.

      Entity_Type_Definition:
        The path followed by the center of a major landfalling hurricane.  A 
        major landfalling hurricane is one that made landfall in the United 
        States and that was classified on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale 
        as a Category 3, 4, or 5 hurricane at the time of landfall.  A 
        hurricane is a warm-core tropical cyclone in which the maximum 
        sustained surface wind is 64 knots/74 mph or more.  A landfalling 
        storm is defined as a storm whose center is reported to have either 
        crossed or passed directly adjacent to the United States coastline, 
        and which came ashore with tropical storm intensity or greater.

          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: 
            There is no given name for the storm.  Prior to 1950 storms were 
            not named.  Later storms that were not recognized as tropical 
            storms or hurricanes at the time of their occurrence are also not 
            named.

      Attribute_Label: Location
      Attribute_Definition:
        A code indicating where in the United States the storm made landfall 
        or impacted a point along the coast, and at what intensity, in the 
        format HR ST#.  ST is the two-character State abbreviation, or a 
        location code from the table below, and # is the intensity 
        classification on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.  Additional 
        codes in the string (HR ST# ST#, etc.) indicate the location and 
        intensity of the storm when it passed back over water or impacted 
        additional points along the coast with hurricane-force winds.  A 
        storm may make landfall multiple times.

        For example, Hurricane Andrew (1992) has a location code of 
        HRCFL5BFL4 LA3, which means that Andrew made landfall as a Category 
        5 hurricane on the southeast coast of Florida, crossed the peninsula 
        and exited as a Category 4 hurricane on the southwest coast of 
        Florida, crossed the Gulf of Mexico and then made final landfall on 
        the Louisiana coast as a Category 3 hurricane.

          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: 
            The storm was classified as a tropical disturbance at the time of 
            the advisory.  A tropical disturbance is a discrete tropical 
            weather system of apparently organized convection (i.e. 
            thunderstorm activity), which is generally 100 to 300 nautical 
            miles in diameter.  It originates in the tropics or subtropics, 
            has a nonfrontal migratory character, and maintains its identity 
            for 24 hours or more.  It does not necessarily exhibit 
            circulation, but may develop into a tropical cyclone.

          Enumerated_Domain_Value_Definition: 
            The storm was classified as Extratropical at the time of the 


            advisory.  Extratropical is a term used in advisories and 
            tropical summaries to indicate that a cyclone has lost its 
            tropical characteristics.  The term implies both that the cyclone 
            has moved out of the tropics and that the energy source driving 
            the storm has changed.  While tropical cyclones derive their 
            energy from the convection of warm, moist air, extratropical 
            storms derive their energy from the temperature contrast between 
            warm and cold air masses.  It is important to note that cyclones 
            can become extratropical and still retain winds of hurricane or 
            tropical storm force.
